summary: I got a PR merged into Rust, wow, that's pretty cool!

A month or two ago I was on the #rust IRC when someone discovered that `pow()` didn't act quite right for unsigned numbers.
This was a bug that was isolated to a single function, so it seemed like something that I could handle.
The issue got posted, I claimed it and debugged it, and actually managed to fix it!
It took a little while, but very early this morning PR #34942 [*Fix overflow checking in unsigned pow()*][issue34942] was merged.
Now I'm a contributor to Rust!

[issue34942]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/34942#event-795131414

Try to find a small thing that you can fix in something that you use.
Somewhere in there is the right issue that you can fix.
It's a great experience.
(I really look forward to the release notes for 1.12...)
