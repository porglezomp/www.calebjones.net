summary: I talk about several different nice experiences
status: draft

On Wednesday I moved into my dorm at U of M.
Everyone's been so nice, and I've already done new and interesting things!
Because of how much has happened, and because I'm tired, this story comes to you in disjointed parts.

# Living Arts

I'm in [Living Arts][], one of the Michigan Learning Communities.
It's a group dedicated to encouraging creativity by mixing students studying engineering, art, science, music, performance, architecture, and more.
It's already been great just meeting people interested in so many different thingsâ€”I've already played music with a few different people.

One aspect of Living Arts is the required UARTS 150 class, *Intro to the Creative Process* in which you learn about creative applications across disciplines.
Segments of the class are taught by art, architecture, engineering, writing, and music.
Immediately it reminds me of humanities class, I'm really looking forward to it.

## Making Instruments

Our first Living Arts group project was building musical instruments out of scraps found in the back room.

                The instruments are coming along well so far! Students were able to use materials from our equipment room as well as anything else they find on campus. We&#39;re taking found object art to a whole new level! #livingarts #umich #foundobjects</a>

This specific picture isn't of my group: here you can see Daniel's group building their *Musical Chair(s)*.

# Game Night

## Cosmic Encounters

## Stranger Things

We watched 3 episodes as a big group.
This was fun to watch!

# Escapade

Piano dance

# Blue Mix

Saturday night I went down to the *Go-Blue Mix*, a bunch of welcome-week stuff on the diag.

## Cycling

The bus from Bursley kept filling up.
After watching the third bus leave, three mentors and I decided to bike to central campus.

## Theorems!

I was taught the basics of projective geometry, with the specific example being [Pappus's Hexagon Theorem][].

Dependent type theory (presented using notation from [Idris][])
