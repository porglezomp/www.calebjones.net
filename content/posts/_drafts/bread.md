My dad has made his own bread for years, and for the past few months of living on my own, I've been making bread following the same recipe.
This bread is a delightful sourdough round, that you can make using essentially no fancy tools, and a single dollar of ingredients.

> **Note:** These recipes are written to work with King Arthur flour, either all-purpose flour or bread flour.
> Almost any other flour should work, but the hydration is calibrated for this flour.

There are three things that you have to do in order to keep making your own bread:

* [Make the sourdough starter.](#making-the-starter)
  This takes a while, but you only need to do this once, and then you're good to go practically forever!

* [Feed the starter.](#feeding-the-starter)
  You use up some of your starter every time you make a loaf of bread.
  Feeding the starter keeps up the mass, and keeps it fresh.

* [Bake a loaf of bread.](#baking-the-bread)
  (Then you get to eat it!)

# Making the Starter

Making the starter takes about two weeks.
Ideally, you get someone near you to share some of their starter with you, although it's possible to
If you'd like me to mail you some starter, then [ask me on twitter][].

You'll want to use un-chlorinated water.
You can dechlorinate tap water by boiling it and leaving it to sit out, or just using bottled water.

<!-- * Start with equal weight of flour and water. -->
Mix about 2 Tbsp of flour with equal weight of water.
Leave it out on counter, covered, and stir it about every 8-12 hours for 2 days.

For the rest of the week, feed it every day with about 2 Tbsp of flour and equal weight of water, stirring every 8 hours.
At the end of the week it should be pretty bubbly.
Weigh it, and add 1/2 that weight of flour to make some dough.
Since a Tbsp of flour is about 5g, there should be about 300g of wet starter.
Knead that 5 min and let it rise while covered for 24 hours.

If the dough doubles in volume in about 4 hours, could try to use it to make bread.
Otherwise take 100 g of dough to mix in with 2:1 flour to water feeding to try again.
150 f and 75 water works well.
Yields 300g plus.

# Feeding the Starter

Ingredients:

* 110g water
* 200g flour
* the rest of the starter in pieces

Process:

* mix, kneed until developed and elastic
* put into greased container to ferment overnight.  (note, tight lid will blast off)

Store in refrigerator for up to 3 weeks. If you donâ€™t bake for about 3 weeks, then you should toss all but about 150g of starter and do the above again to restore it to fresh performance.

# Baking the Bread

Bread

Night before the bake

Ingredients:

* 260g water
* 375g flour
* 150g starter in pieces
* 1/2 Tbsp of salt

Process:

* Mix throughly and kneed for 10 minutes.
* Put into a covered bowl with some non-stick spray in it and put it into the fridge overnight.
* In the morning, take it out of the fridge and let it sit out all day.

Next day kneading:

* When you return from work fold it.
* Fold it again about an hour later
* 30 minutes after that, you can shape it into a round and put it in the floured basket to rise.
* After about an hour, preheat the oven to 450
* After 30 minutes more, carefully invert risen dough onto parchment paper that is on a cookie sheet/peel. (use a round that you cut out instead of square.

Oven prep:

* Slash it and brush it all over with water to increase the rise.
* Pull out the shelf that has the stone on it, so you can carefully dump off the parchment/loaf and then top it with a stainless steel bowl.

Cook:

* Leave bowl on for 12 minutes (carefully remove the bowl)
* Bake for 7 more minutes (inspect to see if it needs to be rotated
* Bake for another 15-17 minutes until it is nicely browned.

Let it cool for at least an hour before slicing. Probably best if you give
it until the morning.
